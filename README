STAAR searches a set of PDB files for possible anion-quadrupole 
interactions.

Other files to read in the top-level source directory:

    INSTALL           Installation instructions.
    LICENSE           The GNU General Public License (GPLv3).

STAAR uses the gzstream library for the decompression of PDB files that
are compressed.  The library source code can be found in its entirety
in the gzstream folder.  I did have to make a change to the code 
because the istream '!' operator was not working correctly to check
for a valid open. What I did was to add a failure flag to one of the 
classes and a get function named fail().  It returns true if the file
could not be opened. The gzstream library is freely available under
the LGPLv2.1 library that can be seen in gzstream/COPYING.lib.  For 
more information on the gzstream library, please visit their page at:

The STAAR code was not intended to be library of code that you could 
plug into to develop more code.  This is evident by the amount of 
hoops you would have to jump through just to compile it.  This is
mainly due to the OpenBabel dependency.  However, if you wish to use
it as a library, you should be able to as we have done it a couple
of times.  The only thing that is truly specifc to STAAR are the 
Options.{cpp,hpp} files, but from my recollection nothing else
depends on those files.  There is limited options in the PDB reader
as we were only concerned with the ATOM lines (well, for one of our
side projects, HETATM lines). If you need support for other PDB 
features, you will need to edit PDB.{cpp,hpp}.  Anyway, good luck.

The scripts folder contains some scripts and codes for parsing the 
GAMESS output, added the results to the STAAR output, dealing with
some of the database stuff, etc.

Oh, and if you don't want to use this code on your own computer, we 
have considered developing a web page to take user requests to run on
our own server.  But that is just in talks so far...
